Henry Dorsett Case is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba
City, Japan. Once a talented computer hacker, Case was caught stealing from his
employer. As punishment for his theft, Case's central nervous system was
damaged with a mycotoxin, leaving him unable to access the global computer
network in cyberspace, a virtual reality dataspace called the matrix. Case is
unemployable, suicidal, and apparently at the top of the hit list of a drug
lord named Wage.

Case is saved by Molly Millions, an augmented street samurai and mercenary for a
shadowy American ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to cure Case
in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case jumps at the chance to regain
his life as a 'console cowboy,' but neither Case nor Molly knows what
Armitage is really planning. Case's nervous system is repaired using new
technology that Armitage offers the clinic as payment, but he soon learns
from Armitage that sacs of the poison that first crippled him have beenplaced
in his blood vessels as well. Armitage promises Case that if he completes hi
work in time, the sacs will be removed; otherwise they will dissolve, disabling
him again. He also has Case's pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his
liver, leaving Case incapable of metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines and
apparently ending his drug addiction.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain

In physics thought experiments, a Boltzmann brain is a self-aware entity that
arises due to extremely rare random fluctuations out of a state of
thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, in a homogeneous Newtonian soup,
theoretically by sheer chance all the atoms could bounce off and stick to one
another in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain (though this
would, on average, take vastly longer than the current lifetime of the universe).

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  'Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal', 'Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering'...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  'No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head...'
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        'This is it... this is where I belong...'
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
